This is a website designed for the inART team and audience.

The website features a home page, links to srs and sdd, a todo page and a changelog page.

The home page features a brief introduction about the unity project created and a description about each level you could experience.

The todo page allows members of the inART team to manage each level with what they want to do. It allows you to create, edit, delete, and mark a todo as completed. Creating a todo will allows you to enter your name, description of what need to be done, and priority levels ranging from low-medium-high. You can edit a todo and be able to change the name,description, and priority. Deleting a todo will just remove the todo from the list. Marking a todo as complete will move that todo to a completed list showing who completed the todo, what level, description of what they did, and what time it was completed.
